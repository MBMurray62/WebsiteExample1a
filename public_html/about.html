                         I grew up in an Irish-speaking family in an atmosphere of Irish language, 
                         music and culture in the wider context of the English speaking capital 
                         city of Ireland, Dublin. From the age of 5, I received an excellent all-round 
                         classical music education in the Royal Irish Academy of Music, Dublin and a
                        ll the performing experience I had as a child made me hopeful of a future career
                        as a classical violinist.

                        However, on completion of my studies, I was asked to join rock band 
                        In Tua Nua in 1985, and my musical interests took a new turn. For the 
                        first time in my life, I discovered the challenges but also the sheer 
                        fun of improvising. With In Tua Nua, I performed on the two albums 
                        released by the band with Virgin Records, ‘Vaudeville’ (1986) and ‘The 
                        Long Acre’ (1987). Life was full with countless gigs around Ireland, 
                        Britain, Europe and the USA including significant performances on ‘Self 
                        Aid’ in 1986, supporting Simple Minds in 1986, and U2 on their Joshua 
                        Tree European tour in 1987.

                      After a thoroughly rock ‘n roll three years, my yearning for classical 
                      playing led me to return to studying, and I kick-started my freelance 
                      classical career by graduating from Trinity College Dublin four years 
                      later with an honours degree in Music.
