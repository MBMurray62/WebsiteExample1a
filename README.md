WebsiteExample1a
================

My submission for CA2 is a compilation of the original website example with some elements I will be using in my project

This website will create a portal through which the owner can communicate with people interested in the work she does, 
inform users on chosen aspects of this work and promote upcoming events/workshops etc.

When the site is completed, it will contain sections that ccan be updated by the owner as well as a C.V, 
sections on all aspects of her work, links to connected sites and social media, and provide contact details 
so that potential customers can easily get in touch.

The user demographic is wide but will consist mainly of potential customers or employers and  potential 
collaborators in her field.   They will be reached by promoting the site through social media , advertising 
at related events and printed material.
